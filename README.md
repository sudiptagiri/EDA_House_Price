# EDA_House_Price
performed various tasks like Analysis, Python coding and debugging of Python code. All the tasks was based on conceptual understanding of the EDA and preprocessing
*Analysis and EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis):*
   - Start by understanding your dataset: its structure, columns, and types of data.
   - Use summary statistics and visualizations to explore the data distribution, trends, and outliers.
   - Identify missing values and handle them appropriately.
   - Consider correlation analysis to understand relationships between variables.
*Python Coding for Analysis:*
   - Utilize libraries like Pandas for data manipulation, NumPy for numerical operations, and Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualization.
   - Example: 
     python
     import pandas as pd
     import numpy as np
     import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
     
      # Load data
     data = pd.read_csv('your_dataset.csv')

     # EDA
     summary_stats = data.describe()
     correlation_matrix = data.corr()

     # Visualization
     plt.scatter(data['X'], data['Y'])
     plt.xlabel('X')
     plt.ylabel('Y')
     plt.show()
